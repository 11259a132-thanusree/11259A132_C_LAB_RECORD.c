Problems in Decision Making Statements

(i) Find the Biggest Among 3 Numbers

AIM :

To develop a C program that reads three numbers from the user and determines the largest among them using decision-making statements (if-else).

ALGORITHM :

Start the program.

Declare three variables: a, b, and c.

Ask the user to input three numbers.

Use scanf to read the numbers.

Compare the numbers using:

If a >= b AND a >= c, then a is the largest.

Else if b >= a AND b >= c, then b is the largest.

Else c is the largest.

Display the largest number.

End the program.


** PROGRAM ** :


#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
int a, b, c;
printf("Enter three numbers: ");
scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
if(a >= b && a >= c)
printf("%d is the largest\n", a);
else if(b >= a && b >= c)
printf("%d is the largest\n", b);
else
printf("%d is the largest\n", c);
return 0;
}

**SAMPLE OUTPUT**

Enter three numbers: 15 9 22

22 is the largest

**FINAL RESULT**

The program successfully identifies and displays the largest of the three input numbers.



(ii) Find Even or Odd

**AIM**

To write a C program that checks whether a given integer is even or odd using the modulus (%) operator.

**ALGORITHM**

Start the program.

Declare an integer variable num.

Ask the user to enter a number.

Read the input using scanf.

Check if num % 2 == 0:

If true, print that the number is even.

Otherwise, print that it is odd.

End the program.


** PROGRAM ** :
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
int num;
printf("Enter a number: ");
scanf("%d", &num);
if(num % 2 == 0)
printf("%d is Even\n", num);
else
printf("%d is Odd\n", num);
return 0;
}

**SAMPLE OUTPUT**

Enter a number: 17
17 is Odd

FINAL RESULT

The program correctly determines whether a user-entered number is even or odd.

The program correctly performs the arithmetic operation selected by the user using switch-case



(iii) Arithmetic Operations using Switch Case

AIM

To write a C program that performs one of the arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) based on the user’s choice using the switch-case statement.

ALGORITHM

Start the program.

Declare variables a, b, and choice.

Ask the user to enter two numbers.

Display a menu with four arithmetic operation choices.

Read the user's choice.

Use a switch statement:

Case 1: Add the numbers.

Case 2: Subtract second from first.

Case 3: Multiply the numbers.

Case 4: Divide first by second (typecast to float).

Default: Print an invalid choice message.

Display the result.

End the program.

Program :

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
int a, b, choice;
printf("Enter two numbers: ");
scanf("%d %d", &a, &b);
printf("1.Addition\n2.Subtraction\n3.Multiplication\n4.Division\n");
printf("Enter your choice: ");
scanf("%d", &choice);
switch(choice) {
case 1: printf("Sum = %d\n", a + b); break;
case 2: printf("Difference = %d\n", a - b); break;
case 3: printf("Product = %d\n", a * b); break;
case 4: printf("Quotient = %.2f\n", (float)a / b); break;
default: printf("Invalid choice\n");
}
return 0;
}


SAMPLE OUTPUT


Enter two numbers: 20 5
1.Addition
2.Subtraction
3.Multiplication
4.Division
Enter your choice: 4
Quotient = 4.00

FINAL RESULT

The program correctly performs the arithmetic operation selected by the user using switch-case
