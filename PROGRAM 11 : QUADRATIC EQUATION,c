**Quadratic Equation Roots**

**AIM** :

To write a C program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0 and determines whether the roots are real and distinct, real and equal, or imaginary.

**ALGORITHM** :

Start the program.

Declare variables a, b, c, d, r1, r2.

Ask the user to enter the coefficients a, b, and c.

Calculate the discriminant: d = b*b - 4*a*c.

Check the discriminant:

If d > 0:

Roots are real and distinct.

r1 = (-b + sqrt(d)) / (2*a)

r2 = (-b - sqrt(d)) / (2*a)

Print both roots.

Else if d == 0:

Roots are real and equal.

r1 = r2 = -b / (2*a)

Print the root.

Else (d < 0):

Roots are imaginary.

Print a message.

End the program.

 ** SAMPLE OUTPUT ** :

Case 1: Real and Distinct Roots

Enter coefficients a, b, c: 1 -5 6

Roots are real: 3.00 and 2.00


Case 2: Real and Equal Roots

Enter coefficients a, b, c: 1 -4 4

Both roots are equal: 2.00


Case 3: Imaginary Roots

Enter coefficients a, b, c: 1 2 5

Roots are imaginary.

 ** FINAL RESULT **

The program successfully calculates the roots of a quadratic equation and determines their type (real and distinct, real and equal, or imaginary) based on the discriminant
